<h1>LED CONTROLLER</h1> 

This is another PCB design exercise I did. It's a LED controller with the following features:
- Allows the regulation of LED brightness.
- Allows the choice of color if it's an RGB LED.
- Allows a supply voltage of 100-240V AC.
- It has 12V DC / 5A and 24V DC / 2.5A outputs.
- It has WiFi and Bluetooth communication.
- And more.
