<h1>PCB Designs for PLATZI course</h1>

This repository contains the projects I completed during the Platzi course on PCB design. These projects are exactly as I left them at the end of the course, despite any errors I may have made in the designs (LOL). It was an excellent basic course that helped me learn the fundamentals of PCB design.

<h1>Projects</h1>

The following are the projects included in this repository:

1. Small Power Supply
2. Development Board (like Arduino Uno but better)

<h1>Course Information</h1>

If you are interested in learning PCB design, I highly recommend taking the Platzi course on [Circuitos Electr√≥nicos ‚Üó](https://platzi.com/cursos/circuitos-electronicos/). This course covers all the basics of PCB design and provides hands-on experience with projects.

<h1>üöÄ Getting Started</h1>

To get started with these projects, simply clone this repository and open the project files in your preferred PCB design software. You can then modify and customize the designs as you see fit.

<h1>ü§ù Contributing</h1>

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any suggestions for improving these projects or would like to add your own, feel free to open a pull request.

<h1>üìù License</h1>
